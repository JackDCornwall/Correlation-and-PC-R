# Correlation and PC Analuysis

This code is designed to exploit built in R functions to do correlation and principal component analysis on glass compositions with respect to crystallisation outcomes; it has been set up to look at both binary and continuous outcomes.
The input files are obfuscated as they are proprietary data.

## Installation

Download and Run in R.

## Usage

Requires input file containing glass compositions and either binary output such as "crystallises" vs "does not crystallise" or continuous output such as measured crystalline volume. Last column is always taken as output.

## License

At this point No licence, please do not re-use as I am uploading to github for referencing purposes.
